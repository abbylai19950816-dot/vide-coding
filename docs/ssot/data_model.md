# Data Model

## Firestore Documents

### `public_booking/state`

Public mirror used by the student page.

Expected data:

- `slots`: future public schedule and minimal booking occupancy.
- `booking_cfg`: public booking configuration.
- `updatedAt`: timestamp.
- `reason`: sync reason.

Cost rule: keep this document small. If it approaches 700 KiB, split by month.

### `student_lookup/{hash}`

Per-student lookup document keyed by normalized `name|phone` SHA-256.

Expected data:

- `studentId`
- `name`
- `phoneMasked`
- `remainingByType`
- `totalRemaining`
- `usedOncePlanIds`
- `usedOncePlanKeys`
- `noRecurringTypeIds`
- `unresolvedTickets`
- `updatedAt`

Rules:

- Student page may get one document.
- Student page must not list this collection.
- Admin sync owns writes.
- 若管理員端看得到票券，但學生端用姓名＋手機查不到方案，優先檢查 `student_lookup/{hash}` 是否存在。設定頁的「強制重建學員查詢」可略過本機 hash cache，重新寫入 `public_booking/state`、`student_lookup` 與 `phone_lookup`。

### `phone_lookup/{hash}`

Public single-document phone index keyed by normalized phone SHA-256.

Expected data:

- `exists: true`
- `phoneMasked`
- `updatedAt`

Rules:

- Student page may get one document before purchase submission to prevent duplicate phone registration.
- Student page must not list this collection.
- This document must not expose student name, full phone, payments, tickets, or private notes.
- Admin sync owns writes.
- 測試資料清空或跨裝置手動清理索引後，必須同步清除/略過本機 `low_cost_phone_lookup_hash_*` cache，否則管理員端可能誤判雲端索引已存在。

### `/data/{key}`

Legacy private single-document arrays:

- `/data/students`
- `/data/tickets`
- `/data/payments`
- `/data/classes`
- `/data/course_logs`
- `/data/slots`
- `/data/booking_cfg`

Rules:

- Admin page may read/write.
- Student page should not bulk-read these documents for normal display.
- Booking transaction may touch only the required documents until a backend exists.

#### `/data/payments` discount fields

Payment records store the actual receivable amount after any custom discount. Course plans remain the source for sessions and validity; discounts must not change ticket sessions.

Expected payment amount fields:

- `phone`: student phone copied onto the payment when available, used by the admin finance UI to disambiguate same-name students.
- `originalAmount`: original course/package price before discount.
- `discountAmount`: custom discount amount. Clamp to `0 <= discountAmount <= originalAmount`.
- `discountReason`: short admin note for the custom offer, such as old-student discount, event offer, or friend referral.
- `amount`: net receivable amount after discount, calculated as `originalAmount - discountAmount`.

Rules:

- Admin payment detail may edit discount fields.
- Admin finance lists and payment detail should display student phone. Older payment records without `phone` may resolve phone from `/data/students` on the admin page only.
- If a paid payment already created a linked ticket, updating the discount only updates the linked ticket `price`; it does not create another ticket and does not change `total`, `left`, `expireDate`, or plan identity.
- Student purchase requests still submit the public plan amount only. Admin imports them as unpaid payments with `discountAmount: 0`; any custom offer is applied later by admin.
- No student page reads or writes are added for discounts.

#### Payment deletion cascade

Admin `delete payment` is for test data, mistaken entries, or transactions that should be treated as never having existed.

When deleting a payment, the system must remove data derived from that payment:

- `/data/payments`: remove the payment record.
- `/data/tickets`: remove tickets whose `paymentId` or `sourcePaymentId` matches the payment.
- `/data/slots`: remove bookings created by those tickets, using ticket log `slotIds`.
- `/data/students`: remove matching `scheduledBookings`.
- `/data/classes`: remove matching attendance members; remove an empty class row if no members remain.
- `/data/course_logs`: remove the matching student from the course log; remove the whole log if no students remain.
- `student_lookup` / `phone_lookup`: update through the existing low-cost sync path so the student page no longer sees deleted plans.

This delete path intentionally erases history. It should be used for incorrect or test records, not normal refunds.

#### Booking ticket deduction and refund logs

When a booking consumes a ticket, the ticket log should include the related slot id:

- `log[]` / `logs[]`: append an item with `action`, `date`, `slotIds`, optional request/source fields, and `note`.
- `slotIds`: array of `/data/slots` ids affected by that ticket change.

Rules:

- Canceling one booking or deleting a calendar slot must first find the original ticket by matching `studentId` and `slotIds`.
- If old data does not have `slotIds`, fallback may use the same student plus matching `typeId` / course type.
- Do not refund by student name alone except as a legacy last resort when the booking has no `studentId` and no phone.
- When deleting a calendar slot, remove the same booking from the student's `scheduledBookings` using the resolved student id and exact slot id.

#### Future refund / void workflow

正式營運需要另一個行為：「退款 / 作廢方案」。

Refund or void should preserve historical records instead of deleting them:

- Keep original payment, booking, attendance, and course logs for audit history.
- Mark the payment or ticket with a status such as `refunded`, `voided`, or `cancelled`.
- Make remaining sessions unavailable for future booking.
- Keep past attendance and course logs visible to admins.
- Student lookup should exclude unavailable sessions, but admin history should remain traceable.

This workflow is not implemented yet. Do not reuse `delete payment` as the long-term refund workflow.

#### Data health check

管理員端設定頁提供 `資料一致性檢查`。這是 read-only 測試/維運工具，用來找出收費、票券、預約、行事曆、出缺勤與課程日誌之間的不同步狀況。

定位：

- 測試期、資料清理、資料遷移、客服維運時使用。
- 正式上線後不應作為一般老師每天操作的日常功能。
- 多老師 SaaS 版本中，應改為只開放給平台維運者或 tenant owner 的進階診斷工具。
- 若系統資料流穩定，正式 UI 可以收合、隱藏或放入維運模式。

第一版檢查範圍：

- 重複手機號碼。
- 收費紀錄找不到學員。
- 已收款但沒有對應票券。
- 同一筆收費產生多張票券。
- 已收款但堂數資訊不明。
- 票券找不到學員。
- 票券 `left`、`used`、`total` 數字不一致。
- 行事曆有預約但學員 `scheduledBookings` 沒有同步。
- 學員 `scheduledBookings` 指向不存在的時段，或行事曆名單沒有該學員。
- 預約缺少含 `slotIds` 的票券扣堂紀錄。
- 已發生預約沒有對應課程日誌。
- 出缺勤或課程日誌成員找不到學員。
- 管理員端有有效票券，但 `student_lookup/{hash}` 不存在。
- `student_lookup/{hash}` 的剩餘堂數與管理員端推算結果不同步。
- 有剩餘票券，但票券課程類型無法對應目前公開課表課程類型。
- 票券目前 `left` 與依票券 log 推算的剩餘堂數不同。
- 同一位學員同課程類型同時有多張有效票券。

Rules:

- This tool must not write Firestore data.
- This tool may read existing admin-side local cache loaded from `/data/*`; it may also read expected `student_lookup/{hash}` documents from the admin page for maintenance diagnostics. It must not add student-side reads.
- Each issue should show admin-friendly guidance: what the issue means, likely impact, and the suggested next step.
- `danger` issues should be treated first because they may affect paid sessions, remaining tickets, or active bookings.
- `warn` issues may be historical/test-data inconsistencies, but still need review before production use.
- Repair tools must remain separate from health check results. The admin should review severe issues before any automatic repair is introduced.
- Lookup-related issues may show a scoped repair entry, such as `重建學員查詢`, which calls the same force rebuild workflow documented below.
- Course-log orphan member issues may show a scoped repair entry, `清除孤兒日誌成員`, which removes only missing `studentIds` and their same-index `studentNames` from `/data/course_logs`.
- Ticket recalculation issues may show a scoped read-only entry, `查看票券重算報告`. This report must not write data.
- Future repair actions must write their own worklog and clearly state which source of truth is used to rebuild derived data.

#### Ticket recalculation report

`票券重算報告` is a read-only diagnostic report. It helps compare current ticket state with what can be inferred from ticket logs.

Inputs:

- `/data/tickets`
- `/data/students`
- `/data/slots`

Displayed fields:

- Current `total`, `used`, and `left`.
- Deductions inferred from ticket `log[]` / `logs[]`.
- Refunds, makeups, and manual adds inferred from logs.
- Expected remaining sessions only when no manual `edit` log and no missing-`slotIds` deduct/refund log prevents deterministic calculation.
- Matching bookings by student and course type.
- Missing `slotIds` in ticket logs.
- Same-student same-course active ticket count.

Rules:

- This report must not auto-fix tickets.
- If a ticket has manual `edit` logs, the report should mark it as requiring human review and must not show a deterministic expected-left value.
- Missing `slotIds` means cancellation/refund matching is less reliable. The report should mark the ticket as requiring human review and must not compare the current `left` against a deterministic expected-left value.
- A same-course multi-ticket warning is not necessarily an error, but it should be reviewed before automatic refund or correction logic is trusted.

#### Course log orphan member cleanup

`清除孤兒日誌成員` is a maintenance repair for test-data cleanup or deleted-student residue.

Behavior:

- Source of truth: `/data/students` current student ids.
- Target: `/data/course_logs`.
- Remove each `studentIds[]` entry that does not exist in `/data/students`.
- Remove the same index from `studentNames[]` so ids and names do not become misaligned.
- Decrease `attendance` by the number of removed members when `attendance` is numeric.
- Keep the course log row even if no students remain; empty historical logs can be reviewed or deleted separately.

Rules:

- This repair must not delete students, tickets, payments, slots, or classes.
- The admin must confirm the affected log/member count before writing.
- After cleanup, rerun `資料一致性檢查`.

#### Public lookup force rebuild

管理員端設定頁提供「強制重建學員查詢」。這是維運工具，用於以下情境：

- 管理員端學員資料與票券顯示正常，但學生端用姓名＋手機查不到可用方案。
- 測試資料清空、手動刪除 `student_lookup` / `phone_lookup`、或跨裝置操作後，本機 hash cache 與雲端公開索引不一致。
- 課程方案或課表曾大量調整，需要重新產生學生端查詢索引。

Rules:

- 此工具會重新寫入 `public_booking/state`、所有可產生的 `student_lookup/{hash}` 與 `phone_lookup/{hash}`。
- 此工具只應由管理員在設定頁手動執行，不應放到學生端。
- 此工具不增加學生端讀取；學生端仍只讀 `public_booking/state`、`web_config/flags` 與單筆 `student_lookup/{hash}`。
- 正常資料變更仍應使用 hash/diff 同步，避免每次儲存都重寫所有公開索引。

### `purchase_requests/{requestId}`

Public create-only buffer for student purchase submissions.

Expected data:

- `name`
- `phone`
- `phoneDigits`
- `social`
- `note`
- `customFields`
- `typeId`
- `typeName`
- `planId`
- `planName`
- `sessions`
- `amount`
- `oncePerStudent`
- `allowRecurring`
- `date`
- `status: pending`
- `createdAt`
- `source`

Rules:

- Student page may create only.
- Student page may not read, list, update, or delete.
- Admin page imports pending requests in the background and converts them into `/data/students` plus `/data/payments`.

### `booking_requests/{requestId}`

Public create-only buffer for student booking submissions.

Expected data:

- `lookupKey`
- `slotIds`
- `typeId`
- `remainingKey`
- `bookingName`
- `studentId`
- `typeKey`
- `status: pending`
- `createdAt`
- `source`

Rules:

- Student page may create only.
- Student page may not read, list, update, or delete.
- Admin page imports pending requests in the background, validates capacity and ticket availability, then updates private data and public mirrors.

## localStorage

localStorage keys beginning with `pilates_` are cache only. They must not become the source of truth for booking correctness.
